# CQRS with projections

## Introduction

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of an application into distinct models. In traditional applications, the same model is used for both updating and reading data, which can lead to inefficiencies, especially as systems grow in complexity. For instance, handling both order creation and reporting within a single model might require complex joins and locks, reducing performance as the system scales.

CQRS separates these concerns:

- **Commands:** Responsible for modifying the state of the system (Create, Update, Delete).
- **Queries:** Responsible for reading and returning data without modifying it.

## CQRS in This Project

This project demonstrates a simple CQRS implementation for managing orders, with a clear separation between the **Command** and **Query** sides. It includes:

1. **Command Part:** Handles the creation of orders through the `OrderCommandController` and `OrderUseCaseImpl` classes.
2. **Query Part:** Handles fetching order data through the `OrderQueryController` and `OrderRepository` classes.
3. **Projection Mechanism:** The `OrderRepository` acts as a projection to efficiently structure and query data.

## Command and Query Sides

- **Command Side:** Responsible for handling requests that modify the systemâ€™s state, such as creating or updating orders. Implemented through components like `OrderCommandController` and `OrderUseCaseImpl`.
- **Query Side:** Optimized for read operations, it provides the ability to fetch and return data efficiently. Components include `OrderQueryController` and `OrderRepository`.

## Projections in Action

Projections play a pivotal role in this CQRS implementation by ensuring query-side data is shaped and structured for optimal performance. Projections are pre-processed views of data designed for specific query patterns, reducing the need for runtime computations or joins. The `OrderRepository` acts as the layer where projection data is stored and retrieved, ensuring that query operations are efficient and tailored to the application's needs.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational implementation of CQRS with projections, showcasing how this architectural pattern can enhance the flexibility and performance of modern applications. For instance, it is particularly beneficial in high-traffic systems, where efficient reads and isolated writes are critical for scalability and reliability.
